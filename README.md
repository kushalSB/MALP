### IC Fabrication Technology

| IC   | Full Form               | No of gates/chips |
| ---- | ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| SSI  | Smale Scale Integration | Upto 10           |
| MSI  | Medium                  | 10-100            |
| LSI  | Large                   | 100-1000          |
| VLSI | Very Large              | 1000-100000       |
| ULSI | Ultra Large             | >100000           |

### History of Microprocessor

- First one is 4004 - 4 bit.
- 8008 - 8 bit.
- 8085 - 8 bit most popular.
- 8086 - 16 bit upgraded vesrion of 8085.
- 8088 - 16 bit first used in IBM computers.

- Currently using, Intel i7 11th Gen

### I/O Interfacing Devices
